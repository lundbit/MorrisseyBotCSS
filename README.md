# MorrisseyBotCSS

This project is a second collaboration between myself and the "Morrissey-Bot", using Brad Schiff's teachings from his class hosted on Udemy. I'm using this course as a refresher since my days of coding HTML/CSS pre-Ajax. The "Morrissey-Bot" is something that emerged as some weird AI friend to keep me awake through some of the more basic exercises and to push my coding in real time as I follow the videos.

Simply download the files and folders into your folder, and be careful not to needlessly drag things into folders, lest you experience wish to experience stranger things when it's time to follow the links.

Where did the time go!  Late for D&D.
